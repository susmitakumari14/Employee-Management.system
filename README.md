## Brief Summary
- I developed a **RESTful API** using **Spring Boot and MySQL for the back-end**, tested it with **Postman**, and integrated it into a **React front-end using axios**.
- **CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE (CRUD)** appliction.
- This repository contains the **front-end** of a **Full Stack** **personal project**, which is **responsible for displaying employee information from the back-end** and is implemented using **React** which serves as the **user interface** for the **user**.
- This application allows users to **view, add, remove, and edit** individuals within their management system.
- This project is now **fully utilised** by my **community's sports club**.

## ‚úèÔ∏èDesign - Front-end
### Front-end Technology Stack
#### React & npm Packages
- The **front-end user interface** of the application was built using **React**, allowing users to **interact and utilise** the application. Additionally, **React** was employed to **retrieve data from the back-end and present it on the front-end for user visibility**.
- The **npm axios package** was used to make **HTTP requests, supporting promises, interceptors, and JSON data transformation**.
- More specifically, the **front-end** user interface, built with **React**, utilises **Axios** to enable users to perform **PUT, GET, POST, and DELETE operations** on their information. These actions are **reflected in real-time, updating the corresponding data on the back-end**.
- The **npm package react-router-dom** was used to provide components including **`<BrowserRouter>`, `<Switch>`, `<Route>`, and `<Link>`** to handle **client-side routing, rendering different components based on the URL path, and creating navigation links between different pages within the application**.
#### Bootstrap
- **Bootstrap** is a **front-end framework** for building **responsive web pages and applications, offering pre-built components and styles**.
- For this project, **Bootstrap** was employed to **facilitate the construction of the navigation bar**. This feature enables users to **conveniently access** their employee information within the application.
- **Bootstrap** was additionally utilised to aid in the **creation of the table that showcases employee information**. This integration ensures a **visually appealing and responsive table layout** for an **enhanced user experience**.
